# Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

This PR addresses the issues reported in the GitHub issue "Great idea but doesn't work":

### 1. Missing logs volume in docker-compose.yml ✅
- **Problem**: The logs directory was created but not mounted as a volume, so logs were lost when the container was recreated
- **Solution**: Added `./logs:/app/logs` volume mapping to docker-compose.yml

### 2. 0.0.0.0 in M3U playlist URLs ✅
- **Problem**: When SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0, the generated M3U playlists contained URLs like `http://0.0.0.0:6880/...` which are invalid for clients
- **Solution**: Modified `get_base_url()` function in `app/api/xtream.py` to:
  - Detect when SERVER_HOST is 0.0.0.0
  - Use the actual request's Host header or URL to build proper URLs
  - Support reverse proxy headers (x-forwarded-host, x-forwarded-proto)
  - Now generates URLs like `http://192.168.100.130:6880/...` based on how clients connect

### 3. SERVER_HOST binding error in Docker ✅
- **Problem**: Setting SERVER_HOST to a specific IP (e.g., 192.168.100.130) in Docker caused "cannot assign requested address" error
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated documentation to clarify that SERVER_HOST should remain 0.0.0.0 for Docker deployments
  - Added comments in .env.example explaining this behavior
  - Updated README with a dedicated "Important Notes for Docker" section

### 4. Missing /playlist.m3u endpoints ✅
- **Problem**: The README documented endpoints like `/playlist.m3u?search=sport` but they were not implemented
- **Solution**: Implemented the `/playlist.m3u` endpoint with support for:
  - `GET /playlist.m3u` - Get all channels
  - `GET /playlist.m3u?refresh=true` - Force refresh from scraper
  - `GET /playlist.m3u?category={name}` - Filter by category (partial match)
  - `GET /playlist.m3u?search={query}` - Search channels by name (partial match)
  - Combines filters: `/playlist.m3u?category=Sport&search=football`

## Files Modified

1. **docker-compose.yml** - Added logs volume mapping
2. **app/api/xtream.py** - Fixed get_base_url() and added /playlist.m3u endpoint
3. **.env.example** - Added documentation about SERVER_HOST for Docker
4. **README.md** - Added "Important Notes for Docker" section and clarified /playlist.m3u usage

## Testing

All changes have been validated:
- ✅ Configuration loading works correctly
- ✅ get_base_url() properly handles 0.0.0.0 and generates correct URLs
- ✅ /playlist.m3u route is properly registered
- ✅ docker-compose.yml validates successfully with all volumes
- ✅ All Python files compile without syntax errors

## Usage Examples

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# .env file for Docker (keep SERVER_HOST as 0.0.0.0)
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVER_PORT=6880
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=verystrongpassword

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Access from your network
# URLs will automatically use the IP you connect from
# Example: http://192.168.100.130:6880/get.php?username=admin&password=verystrongpassword&type=m3u_plus
```

### Playlist Endpoints
```bash
# Get all channels
curl http://192.168.100.130:6880/playlist.m3u

# Search for sport channels
curl http://192.168.100.130:6880/playlist.m3u?search=sport

# Get only Sports category
curl http://192.168.100.130:6880/playlist.m3u?category=Sports

# Force refresh and get football channels
curl http://192.168.100.130:6880/playlist.m3u?refresh=true&search=football
```

## Notes

The `/playlist.m3u` endpoint generates playlists with AceStream URLs in the format:
```
http://127.0.0.1:6878/ace/getstream?id={acestream_id}
```

These URLs are intended for local AceStream Engine usage. For remote access with authentication and proper streaming, use the Xtream Codes API endpoints (`/get.php` with username/password).
